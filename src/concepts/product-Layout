1) Components
Header/ → your top navigation bar (with logo, search, categories, etc.)

Footer/ → your bottom section of the site

ProductCard.jsx → small UI box that shows a product’s image, name, price (used in Home, CategoryPage, etc.)

CategoryMenu.jsx → the dropdown or hover menu under “Categories” in your header

Think of this folder like LEGO pieces — small parts that combine to form full pages.

2)          pages/ folder → Big, full-page screens

These are your route-level components, meaning each corresponds to a path in your router (like /, /products/1, /cart, etc.)

Home.jsx → main homepage

CategoryPage.jsx → shows all products of a specific category (e.g. /category/Electronics)

ProductDetail.jsx → single product page (like /products/3)

Cart.jsx → user’s shopping cart

RecentlyViewed.jsx → list of products the user has viewed recently

NotFound.jsx → fallback page for wrong routes (404)
