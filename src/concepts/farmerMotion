Perfect 😄 mate — here’s your fully ready, clean Hero1.jsx version using Framer Motion exactly how you described:
✅ Text lines slide from top one after another
✅ Button slides up from below
✅ Animation triggers only once when in view
✅ Uses TailwindCSS and Framer Motion — no flicker, smooth and clean

Step 1 — What is useAnimation()?

👉 It’s a Framer Motion hook that gives you manual control over animations.
Normally, we do this:

<motion.div initial="hidden" animate="visible" variants={...}>


So Framer Motion controls the animation automatically — first hidden → then visible.

But with useAnimation(), you become the controller.

Example:

const controls = useAnimation(); // 🧠 gives you remote control over animation

<motion.div
  variants={myVariants}
  animate={controls} // 👈 Instead of "visible", we now connect our remote control
/>


Now you can say:

controls.start("visible") // run the animation
controls.start("hidden")  // reverse or hide it again


That’s why it’s called “controls” — it’s like holding a remote for the element’s animation state.

⚙️ Step 2 — What happens in your useEffect()

Here’s the code:

useEffect(() => {
  async function sequence() {
    while (true) {
      await controls.start("visible"); // play animation (stagger)
      await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 1000)); // wait
      controls.set("hidden"); // reset instantly
    }
  }
  sequence();
}, [controls]);


Let’s go through this line by line:

useEffect(() => { ... }, [controls])

This runs once when your component mounts.
It’s used here to start the infinite animation loop automatically.

async function sequence() { ... }

We define an asynchronous function, because we’ll be using await — meaning:

“Wait for one animation or delay to finish before going to the next step.”

while (true) { ... }

This is an infinite loop, so the animation keeps repeating forever.

await controls.start("visible");

This means:

“Start the animation for all children to go from hidden → visible (stagger included).”

Since we use await, the loop waits until the animation finishes before moving to the next step.
Framer Motion automatically knows how long to wait (based on transition.duration).

await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 1000));

Now we tell JavaScript:

“Wait 1000 milliseconds (1 second) before continuing.”

So after one cycle, we pause for 1 second before restarting.

controls.set("hidden");

This line:

“Instantly reset all elements back to their hidden state.”

⚠️ Note:

.set() is instant, no animation, just immediate state change.

If we used .start("hidden") instead, it would animate back to hidden (which can look weird).

So full logic:

Start visible animation → (play the stagger sequence)

Wait 1 second

Instantly hide everything

Loop again forever

💡 Concept Summary (your exact question)

“Without this code, when animation is visible, it animates; when hidden, it doesn’t. Isn’t that the basic?”

✅ Yes — perfectly said.
But that basic version happens once (or only when you scroll into view).

If you want it to replay automatically, you need a loop trigger.
Framer Motion’s built-in repeat doesn’t replay staggered groups, so we handle that with this custom logic.

So what you said is right —

"visible" → it animates (stagger starts)

"hidden" → nothing shows

This code just tells Framer:

“Switch between visible → hidden repeatedly forever.”

🧠 You can visualize it like this
Step	Action	Description
1	controls.set("hidden")	All elements invisible and ready to start
2	controls.start("visible")	Run the whole stagger animation
3	Wait 1 second	Pause
4	Back to hidden instantly	Reset
5	Loop	Do it again forever
🧩 TL;DR

useAnimation() → gives you control (manual animate trigger)

controls.start("state") → runs animation

controls.set("state") → instantly sets to that variant

await → waits for one step to finish before next

while(true) → repeats forever

This is how you loop stagger animations smoothly since repeat doesn’t handle stagger well.
