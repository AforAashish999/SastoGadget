*****************
Remove from Cart
Let’s break it down:

Suppose your state.items looks like this:

[
  { id: 1, name: "iPhone", price: 1000, qty: 2 },
  { id: 2, name: "Laptop", price: 2000, qty: 1 },
  { id: 3, name: "Powerbank", price: 500, qty: 1 },
]


Now the user clicks Remove for the Laptop (id: 2).

Here’s what happens 👇

state.items.filter((item) => item.id !== 2)


➡️ means: “Create a new array that keeps only the items whose id is not equal to 2.”

So the result will be:

[
  { id: 1, name: "iPhone", price: 1000, qty: 2 },
  { id: 3, name: "Powerbank", price: 500, qty: 1 },
]

********************
 if (existingItem.qty > 1) {
      existingItem.qty -= 1;
    } else {
      state.items = state.items.filter((item) => item.id !== removeId);
    }
i mean if item less than 1, qty will be 0 and then remove its id, if it was the logic why need to wrtie inside else, plz explain from first if

🧠 Step 1: What’s happening conceptually

We’re removing an item from the cart, but there are two possible cases:

The user has more than 1 of that product in cart.

The user has exactly 1 of that product in cart.

We need to handle these two differently.

🧩 Step 2: The if condition
if (existingItem.qty > 1)


➡️ This means:

“If this product’s quantity is more than one, just reduce the quantity by one.”

Example:

Before: qty = 3  
After:  qty = 2


✅ The product still stays in the cart — just with fewer units.

🧩 Step 3: The else condition
else {
  state.items = state.items.filter((item) => item.id !== removeId);
}


➡️ This means:

“Otherwise (meaning qty is 1 or less), remove the product completely.”

Example:

Before: qty = 1  
After: product removed from array


If we didn’t use this else, we’d have to write a separate if (qty === 1) block manually.
The else just means “in all other cases,” and since the only other case possible is qty === 1, this is cleaner and faster.
