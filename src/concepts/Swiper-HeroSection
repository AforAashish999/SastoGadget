Quick summary first (so you know the big picture)

Swiper is a battle-tested, touch-friendly slider/carousel library. It gives you arrows, dots (pagination), autoplay, looping, smooth effects, and swipe/touch support out of the box.

Instead of manually tracking current with useState + setInterval, Swiper manages slide state internally and exposes APIs to interact with it when you need to.

You still build each slide however you want (a whole component per slide for your custom layouts).

Now the code you posted, explained line-by-line:

import React from "react";


Basic React import. This file exports a component.

import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from "swiper/react";


Swiper is the main container component (the carousel itself).

SwiperSlide is a wrapper for each slide. You put your slide content inside SwiperSlide.

import { Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay, EffectFade } from "swiper/modules";


These are modules you enable to add functionality:

Navigation → left/right arrow controls.

Pagination → dots/indicators.

Autoplay → automatic slide rotation.

EffectFade → fade transition between slides instead of sliding horizontally.

You must pass these modules into the modules prop on <Swiper /> for them to work.

import "swiper/css";
import "swiper/css/navigation";
import "swiper/css/pagination";
import "swiper/css/effect-fade";


Swiper ships with its own CSS. These imports add the default styles for core, navigation arrows, pagination dots, and the fade effect. If you skip them the layout/controls will look broken.

// Import each unique Hero component
import Hero1 from "./Hero1";
import Hero2 from "./Hero2";


Instead of storing just text, each slide here is a full React component (Hero1, Hero2). That lets each slide have unique sizes/spacing/styles — exactly what you needed.

export default function HeroCarousel() {


Functional component export.

  const slides = [
    { id: 1, component: <Hero1 /> },
    { id: 2, component: <Hero2 /> },
  ];


An array of slides. Each item contains an id and a component property (the full JSX to render).

Using components lets you fully customize layout per slide (fonts, spacing, button position, etc.).

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-[90vh] overflow-hidden">


Outer container sizing. h-[90vh] makes the hero tall; overflow-hidden prevents overflow during transitions.

      <Swiper
        modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Autoplay, EffectFade]}


Here we tell Swiper which modules to enable. Without this line, navigation/pagination/autoplay/effect won’t work.

        navigation


Enables navigation arrows. Swiper will render default arrows (you can style or replace them later).

        pagination={{ clickable: true }}


Enables pagination dots. clickable: true means clicking a dot jumps to that slide.

        effect="fade"
        fadeEffect={{ crossFade: true }}


effect="fade" uses the fade transition instead of the default slide transition.

fadeEffect.crossFade = true gives a smoother overlap fade.

        autoplay={{ delay: 10000, disableOnInteraction: false }}


Enables autoplay. Options:

delay: 10000 → 10,000 ms (10 seconds) between auto slides (this matches what you asked).

disableOnInteraction: false → user interactions (click/drag) won’t stop autoplay permanently. It keeps auto-rotating after manual interaction.

(Optional) you can add pauseOnMouseEnter: true to pause on hover in newer Swiper builds.

        loop={true}


loop makes slides cycle continuously without hitting an “end” (good for hero carousels).

        className="w-full h-full"
      >


Add classes for sizing / custom styling of Swiper container.

        {slides.map((slide) => (
          <SwiperSlide key={slide.id}>{slide.component}</SwiperSlide>
        ))}


We map over the slides array and put each component inside a SwiperSlide.

SwiperSlide is required: Swiper handles DOM and animations for each slide element.

      </Swiper>
    </div>
  );
}


Close tags, component ends.

What “swipe” actually means here

Swiper supports swiping: touch swipes on mobile and click-drag on desktop. That behavior is built-in — you don't implement touch handlers yourself.

It also supports keyboard navigation, mousewheel, free mode, and more via modules/plugins.

How Swiper manages state (vs your friend’s code)

Your friend’s code: uses useState(current) and useEffect with setInterval to change current manually, and toggles opacity classes for fade. You manage everything (timing, z-index, transitions).

Swiper: keeps internal slide index/state, handles timing for autoplay, handles smooth transitions, and provides props & events if you want to react to state changes (e.g. onSlideChange).

If you need programmatic control, you can get a Swiper instance with a ref and call swiper.slideNext(), swiper.slidePrev(), etc.

Small practical extras you’ll likely want

Pause on hover:

autoplay={{ delay: 10000, disableOnInteraction: false, pauseOnMouseEnter: true }}


Control programmatically (custom arrows outside swiper):

import { useRef } from "react";

const swiperRef = useRef(null);

<Swiper onSwiper={(s) => (swiperRef.current = s)} ...>
  ...
</Swiper>

<button onClick={() => swiperRef.current.slidePrev()}>Prev</button>
<button onClick={() => swiperRef.current.slideNext()}>Next</button>


Detect slide change:

<Swiper onSlideChange={(swiper) => console.log("active index:", swiper.activeIndex)} ... />


Add more slides: create Hero3.jsx, Hero4.jsx and push them into slides array.

Why use Swiper (pros) vs manual approach (cons)

Pros (Swiper)

Touch/drag/swipe support out of the box.

Smooth, tested transitions (fade/slide/coverflow/etc).

Built-in navigation, pagination, autoplay, loop.

Less code to maintain and less chance of timing bugs.
Cons

Adds a dependency and some CSS imports.

You need to learn Swiper props/modules (a short learning curve).

Pros (manual with useState)

Very light — no external dependency.

Full control of markup/animation — useful for very custom single-case designs.
Cons

Reimplementing common features (touch detection, looping, smooth transitions).

More code and possible bugs (timers, memory leaks, accessibility).

TL;DR — How to adapt this to your exact need

Use the Swiper approach if you want: autoplay every 10s, arrow controls, dots, fade transitions, and swipe gestures — it’s perfect for full hero banners.

Create a separate component for each distinct hero (as you already planned: Hero1, Hero2, etc.). Put each component into SwiperSlide.

Use autoplay.delay: 10000 for 10s and disableOnInteraction: false so arrows don’t stop autoplay. Add pauseOnMouseEnter if you want hover pause.

If you want, I can:

Convert your friend’s exact hero slide content into separate Hero1, Hero2 components and plug them into Swiper (so you get exactly the same look but with autoplay + arrows).

Show how to add pauseOnMouseEnter and programmatic controls with custom arrow icons (FaChevronLeft/Right) that match your design.
